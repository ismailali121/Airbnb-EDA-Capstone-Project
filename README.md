# Airbnb-EDA-Capstone-Project

For this project, we will be analysing Airbnbâ€™s New York City (NYC) data of 2019. This dataset contains listings information such as listing name, host name, room types, neighbourhood group (location), neighbourhood (area), minimum night to be paid for, availability of listing in days and number of reviews etc.

Our main objective behind this project is to explore and analyse the data to discover the key understandings. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis techniques.
